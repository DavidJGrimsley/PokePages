The Pokemon Company has started a new mystery gift distribution for Pokemon Legends Z-A.

Players can now use the code PREPAR1NG to obtain 5 Max Revives, 10 Full Restore and 10 Ultra Balls. Presumably, this is to prepare players for the upcoming release of the Mega Dimension DLC next week.

You can redeem the code by following these steps:

Unlock Mystery Gift by playing through the main story.
Pause the game and select Link Play
Select Mystery Gift menu and then select “Receive Via Code”
Enter the code
Pokemon will be added to your boxes, and items will be placed in your bag

There's two Mystery Gifts available for Pokémon Legends Z-A, for those that are picking the game up now that it's launched:

If you purchase the digital version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A or Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by February 28, 2026, you’ll receive a serial code for a gift of 100 Poké Balls.
Via Internet (Mystery Gift function): Players that pick up Pokémon Legends Z-A before February 28, 2026 can use the Mystery Gift function to get a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite Stone.
