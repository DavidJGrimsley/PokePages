## INTRO (0:00-0:20)

**[Show Game footage, pre recorded and chopped to show exactly what I'm talking about]**

**YOU:**
"Hey Pokémon trainers! Has this ever happened to you? You're out and see a random alpha and you're like, do I have this one? So you go to your boxes and maybe you have your alphas altogether or maybe you have to search for that species and then look at each one because the games don't have a search filter for their own gimmick forms! Then after 3 minutes of searching you find out you don't have this form so you catch it. The solution is here"
**[Poke Pages anim]**
 "Do you want to catch 'em all - and I mean ALL of them - including every shiny, every alpha, and yes, even those elusive shiny alphas? Then you NEED to check out PokéPages!"
**[Anim Over]**
"In this video, I'm going to show you the most complete Pokédex tracking tool for Legends Z-A built by yours truly. Let's dive in!"

---
**[IntroVideo]**


**YOU:**
"Look, we've all been there. You're deep in your Legends Z-A playthrough, and you catch an amazing shiny alpha Pokémon. Fast forward two weeks or two months..."

**[Pause for effect]**

"...and you have NO idea which forms you've already caught. Did you get that shiny Pikachu? Was it alpha? Did you evolve it and lose track?"

**[Show confused reaction]**

"The in-game pokedex is great, but it doesn't track EVERY form separately.
Do you have a sheet of paper, a notebook, a spreadsheet? these things work but they're not inherently designed for this use case.
 That's where PokéPages comes in!"

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:45-2:30)

**[Screen recording of the app starts here]**

**YOU:**
"PokéPages gives you a complete Pokédex tracker with FOUR different tracking options for every single Pokémon!"

**[Show the form buttons]**

"You've got:
- ⚪ **Normal** - Your regular catches
- ✨ **Shiny** - Those beautiful alternate colors
- 🔴 **Alpha** - The big, powerful alphas
- 👑 **Alpha Shiny** - The ULTIMATE prize - shiny alphas!"

**[Demonstrate tapping buttons to toggle]**

"Just tap a button to mark it as obtained. Gray means you need it, green means you've caught it. It's that simple! Keep in mind this game just came out so if I have anything wrong here please let me know down below but I'll be updating everything as we find out more info later on."

---

### FILTERS SECTION (1:30-1:50)

**[Show the filter buttons]**

**YOU:**
"But wait, it gets better! 
You see I may even want an alpha form for every single pokemon, but I do want alphas for the Pokemon with Mega evolutions
You can filter by:
- **All Pokémon** - See the complete dex
- **Alpha Only** - Focus on those alpha spawns
- **Mega Evolution** - Track Pokémon with mega forms"

**[Demonstrate clicking each filter]**

"This makes it SO much easier to focus on what you're hunting for!"

---

### SEARCH FEATURE (1:50-2:10)

**[Show the search bar]**

**YOU:**
"Need to find a specific Pokémon? Just use the search bar! Type in the name or even the dex number - it works instantly."

**[Type "Pikachu" and show results]**

"No more scrolling through hundreds of Pokémon every time you catch one! I've designed this to be able to be used quickly and efficiently so you spend less time wondering which forms you need and more time catching Pokemon."

---

### PROGRESS TRACKING (2:10-2:30)

**[Show the progress sidebar/stats]**

**YOU:**
"And check this out - you get real-time progress tracking! See exactly how close you are to completing your collection. It even shows you a completion percentage!"
**[Point to the progress numbers]**
"The top bar shows the same as your pokedex. The Normal and shiny dexes are the same entries as the pokedex, but after that it gets interesting.
The alpha dex shows only pokemon that can be caught as alpha, same for shiny alpha.
The mega dex bar will track your normal forms that have a mega evolution
The next 2 here track the same entries but the different forms instead of the normal one. 
You don't have to do anything to these bars, they will automatically get updated as you use the tracker. I'll show you a bit more as we go.
This is perfect for those of us who love that 100% completion feeling!"



---

## SPECIAL FEATURES (2:30-3:15)

**[Show the badges on Pokémon]**

**YOU:**
"Notice these badges? The purple 'M' shows which Pokémon have Mega Evolutions, and the red alpha symbol shows which ones can be found as alphas in the wild."

**[Show the counter badges]**

"Plus, you get a handy counter showing how many forms you've caught out of the total available. I may add a little icon showing complete when you have 4/4. What do you think about that and the UI so far? let me know in the comments."

---

### CLOUD SYNC (3:00-3:15)

**[Show the AuthStatus component or sync indicator]**

**YOU:**
"Here's the BEST part - everything syncs to the cloud! Create a free account, and your progress is saved automatically. Switch phones? No problem. Your collection is always safe!"

**[Show cloud sync icon/indicator]**

"It syncs when you're online, but works offline too. Track your catches anywhere!"

**[Show sign in indicator]**

"This appears if you're not signed in to let you know that if you use a different device, or erase your site or app data, then that progress will be lost. So please sign in! Remember it's free and PokePages does not sell your data."
---

## CALL TO ACTION (3:15-3:45)

**[Show app download screen or link overlay]**

**YOU:**
"So if you're serious about completing your Legends Z-A Pokédex - and I mean REALLY completing it with every shiny and alpha - you need PokéPages!"

"Now I'm going to show how it works in action. This how to use section is just here in case it's not obvious to you or you didn't see this video. Now I'm going to mark a couple of these so you can see the progress bars changing in real time."
**[Click forms of chik line]**

"Now I'm going to really use this thing. First I'm going to pull up my Pokedex and mark the normal form for all of these, keeping in mind ones that I have evolved already - remember this is a form tracker. For instance, I have evolved my Totodile into Feraligatr, so I don't have the normal forms for the whole line."
**[Pull up pokedex, pause while filling up tracker after Feraligatr, Show tracker when done(sign in to actual account)]**

"Now I have all my normal forms in here. You may be wondering why this even needs to be a form at all. Some folks want a form dex, one normal, shiny etc. of each species. You may just want a final form dex or a shiny final form dex. It's up to you to use this tracker however it is useful to you. But regardless, the Pokemon Co started doing rewards for transferring each pokemon into home. It doesn't matter that your dex in the game is complete, what matters is what you bring into Pokemon home. So you may have Fennekin in your dex, but if you evolved it then you won't be bringing it to home for that reward unless you catch another. Before Pokemon home compatibility for Legends:Z-A gets added, I'll do another video on that process so be sure to catch it when it comes"

So What I want to do now is pull up my shinies and then alphas and then alpha shinies and mark these buttons accordingly."
**[Show boxes, pause, show tracker]**
"Alright now you see all these buttons are green indicating I have a pokemon of that form."
**[Point to the progress numbers]**
"And we see my progress on each individual form" 
*Talk about progress and say something like, I'm getting there*


**[Enthusiastic tone]**

"It's completely FREE, works offline, syncs to the cloud, and makes tracking your collection actually FUN! What are you waiting for? Download PokePages today! Or use it on the web."

## OUTRO (3:45-4:00)

**[Show app logo again]**

**YOU:**
"Link is in the description below!"

**[Upbeat ending]**

"If you found this helpful, smash that like button and subscribe for more Pokémon content! What's YOUR dream shiny alpha? Let me know in the comments! Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one!"


**[End screen - gets interrupted ]**

" I know what you're thinking. What about male and female variations."
**[Show Pyroar, then furfrou and florges and vivillon ]**
"What about Furfrou trims and Florges flower colors.. Ahh.. I've thought about it. I want to implement it, but it will be a lot more work on my end. "
"So.. if this video gets 1,000 likes.... I will add the different forms of each pokemon into this form tracker. Also do you guys want box spaces marked for each one like Austin John's previous trackers? Let me know in the comments and until next time, PEACE.
