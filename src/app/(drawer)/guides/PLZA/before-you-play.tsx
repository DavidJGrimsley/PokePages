          <AppText className="text-l font-bold mb-md text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">In Pok√©mon X and Y, players explored the Kalos region and encountered new Pok√©mon, trainers, and challenges.

          <AppText className="text-base mb-md text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            ‚öôÔ∏è **Beginning the Adventure**: In Aquacorde Town, you choose your starter Pok√©mon (Chespin, Fennekin, or Froakie). After traveling through early routes and Santalune Forest, you defeat Bug-type Gym Leader Viola for your first badge. You meet Professor Sycamore in Lumiose City, who introduces Mega Evolution - a new mechanic where certain Pok√©mon temporarily evolve during battle using Mega Stones.
            {"\n\n"}
            ü¶π **Team Flare Conflict**: The villain Lysandre leads Team Flare, initially seeming focused on beauty and aesthetics, but later revealing a sinister plan to use the Ultimate Weapon to destroy humans who don&apos;t meet his vision of beauty and &quot;beautify&quot; the world.
            {"\n\n"}
            üó∫ **Mid-Game Progress**: You earn Gym badges across Kalos&apos;s diverse geography. A key moment is in Shalour City, where you meet Mega Evolution guru Gurkinn and battle Gym Leader Korrina to earn the Mega Ring, allowing you to use Mega Evolution.
            {"\n\n"}
            ‚öîÔ∏è **Climax & Legendary Pok√©mon**: You learn about AZ, a 3,000-year-old former king who used the Ultimate Weapon long ago to revive his special Floette, causing a devastating war. You infiltrate Team Flare&apos;s bases, battle Lysandre, capture the Legendary Pok√©mon (Xerneas or Yveltal), and stop the weapon from being used.
            {"\n\n"}
            üèÜ **Champion & Ending**: After defeating Team Flare, you collect your final Gym badge, challenge the Elite Four, and defeat Champion Diantha to become the new Kalos Champion. During the celebration parade, AZ challenges you to battle, and after you win, his lost Floette returns to him after 3,000 years, bringing him peace.
            {"\n\n"}
            üîç **Post-Game**: Additional content includes detective missions with Looker, accessing Kiloude City, and finding more Mega Stones throughout the region.
