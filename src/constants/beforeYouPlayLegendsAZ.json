    "title": "Backstory",
    "caption": "Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a direct sequel of Pokémon X and Y (taking place 5-10 years after the events of X and Y). While most Pokémon games got a 3rd installment or a DLC to continue the story, 'Pokémon Z' never came out. So this game is the official continuation of the story of Kalos and its characters. This brief recap will get you 'caught up' so dialog and references in Z-A land with meaning. **Spoiler warning: this summarizes major X & Y plot points.**",
    "body": "The story unfolded in the France-inspired Kalos region. The King AZ and his unique Floette connect to Kalos’ dark past and the creation of the Ultimate Weapon. Mega Evolution is introduced in X/Y and its lore is tied to the fallout from the weapon’s activation.",
    "bullets": [
      "Ancient history: AZ's Floette died in a great war so he built the Ultimate Weapon ~3,000 years ago and used it to revive his Floette by draining the life force of many Pokémon; the revival succeeded and granted AZ and Floette unusual longevity, but Floette left him when it discovered the cost of that revival",
      "Starting point: Vaniville Town → meets rival(Serena if the player is male, Calem if the player is female)",
      "Goes to Aquacorde Town → meets friends Shauna, Trevor, Tierno → gets starter Pokémon",
      "Core loop: travel across Kalos, defeat Gym Leaders, collect 8 badges, then challenge the Pokémon League",
      "Mechanics introduced: Mega Evolution (Mega Stones, Mega Ring, Tower of Mastery) — in the post-game, touching the Anistar sundial lets the player (you) locate Mega Stones region-wide",
      "Villain arc: Team Flare (leader Lysandre) wants to use the Ultimate Weapon to 'beautify' the world by destroying those he deems unfit",
      "Reactivation: In X/Y, Lysandre and Team Flare divert power (causing a Lumiose City blackout), exploit the Kalos Power Plant, and attempt to surface/reactivate the buried Ultimate Weapon in Geosenge Town using key energy sources (including summoning the version-legendary)",
      "Weapon firing & collapse: The player (you) confronts Team Flare and captures the Legendary (which reduces much of the weapon's energy), but Xerosic briefly reactivates the device remotely and Lysandre attempts to use remaining energy. The device fires a destructive beam that ultimately destroys its own base — the attack collapses Team Flare's HQ, buries the site, and leaves a large crater in Geosenge Town",
      "Aftermath: The Team Flare HQ is rendered inaccessible and the weapon is ruined; the blast leaves lasting physical and social scars across Kalos. Lysandre's exact fate is left ambiguous in the story",
      "Climax & reunion: After becoming Champion, the player (you) fights AZ in the parade sequence; following that encounter AZ expresses that he now understands what it means to be a Trainer, and Floette appears and reunites with him — a bittersweet emotional resolution to AZ's long guilt",
      "Post-game: Looker detective missions in Lumiose City, Emma / Essentia arc, access to Kiloude City, and further Mega Stone searches"
    ],
    "playPrimer": "Kalos was rebuilt after the reactivation and detonation of an ancient weapon tied to AZ and his Floette. Team Flare attempted to replay that history, but the player (you) stopped them — although the blast (partly absorbed by the Legendary Pokémon, Xerneas or Yveltal) collapsed the device and left a crater in Geosenge, and the political, social, and technological fallout reshaped Lumiose City. Mega Evolution, the Ultimate Weapon, and that trauma are important background; Lumiose’s society — famously obsessed with fashion, beauty, and appearances — now wrestles with rebuilding both infrastructure and civic identity. In Pokémon Legends: Z-A you’ll explore Lumiose after these events and take an active part in the city’s recovery, encountering characters, institutions, and controversies born from Team Flare’s legacy; knowing AZ, Floette, the Ultimate Weapon, and Team Flare will make the story and NPC reactions hit harder."
