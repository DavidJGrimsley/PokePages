# General Raid Strategies

- **Focus on Survival:** Use moves like Light Screen, Reflect, and Acid Spray to support your team. A dead Pokémon deals no damage.
- **Stat Reduction is Key:** Moves that lower the boss's Attack, Special Attack, or Special Defense (like Screech or Metal Sound) are more effective than trying to boost your own stats, as bosses often clear your stat boosts.
- **Tera Type is Everything:** The boss's Tera Type determines its weaknesses. Ignore its original typing for offensive calculations. For example, a Dragon-type Pokémon with a Steel Tera Type is weak to Fire, Fighting, and Ground, not Ice and Dragon.

# Example Build: Iron Hands vs. Tera Normal Blissey

- **Pokémon:** Iron Hands
- **Ability:** Quark Drive
- **Item:** Booster Energy or Punching Glove
- **Moveset:**
  - Drain Punch (for damage and healing)
  - Belly Drum (to maximize attack on turn 1)
  - Thunder Punch (for STAB damage)
  - Close Combat (for high-power fighting damage)
- **Strategy:** Use Belly Drum on the first turn to max out your Attack stat. Then, use Drain Punch to deal damage and stay healthy. Blissey has low physical defense, making this a very effective counter.
