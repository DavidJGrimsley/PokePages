# Font Assets Documentation

This directory contains font assets used in the React Native application. When selecting fonts for your project, consider the following recommendations:

1. **File Formats**:
   - Use **TTF (TrueType Font)** or **OTF (OpenType Font)** for general font usage.
   - Consider using **WOFF (Web Open Font Format)** for web-based applications, as it provides better compression.

2. **Font Licensing**:
   - Ensure that any fonts used are properly licensed for your intended use, whether it's for personal, commercial, or open-source projects.

3. **Performance**:
   - Limit the number of different fonts and weights to improve application performance and loading times.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Choose fonts that are legible and accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.

5. **Fallback Fonts**:
   - Always define fallback fonts in your styles to ensure a good user experience in case the primary font fails to load.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your font assets enhance the overall user experience of your application.
