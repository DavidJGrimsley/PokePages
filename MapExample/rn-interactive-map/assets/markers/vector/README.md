# README for Vector Markers

This directory contains vector marker assets used in the interactive map project for the game "Pokemon Legends Z-A". 

## Marker Formats

For the best performance and scalability, we recommend using the following image file types for map markers:

- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: Ideal for icons and simple graphics. SVGs are resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality, making them perfect for various screen sizes and resolutions.

- **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**: Suitable for raster images that require transparency. PNGs are great for detailed images but may not scale as well as SVGs.

- **Lottie**: For animated markers, Lottie files provide lightweight animations that can enhance the user experience without significantly impacting performance.

## Usage

To use these markers in your application, import them into your components as needed. Ensure that you optimize the markers for performance, especially when rendering multiple markers on the map.

## Contribution

If you wish to add new markers or modify existing ones, please follow the project's contribution guidelines and ensure that all new assets are properly documented.
