# README for Lottie Animation Marker Assets

This directory contains Lottie animation files that are used as markers in the interactive map for the "Pokemon Legends Z-A" game. Lottie is a lightweight animation file format that works on any platform and can be easily manipulated.

## Usage

To use Lottie animations as markers in your React Native application, you can import the Lottie files and render them using a suitable Lottie library, such as `lottie-react-native`. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project.

## File Types

Lottie files are recommended for dynamic and interactive markers due to their scalability and small file size. They can be easily customized and animated, providing a rich user experience.

## Best Practices

- Optimize Lottie animations to reduce file size while maintaining quality.
- Use appropriate fallback images for devices that may not support Lottie animations.
- Test animations on various devices to ensure performance and compatibility.

For more information on creating and exporting Lottie animations, refer to the [Lottie documentation](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/).
