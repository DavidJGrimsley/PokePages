# SVG Marker Assets Documentation

This directory contains SVG marker assets used in the interactive map project for the game "Pokemon Legends Z-A". SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a preferred format for map markers due to its scalability and ability to maintain high quality at any size.

## Recommended Practices for SVG Markers

1. **Scalability**: SVG markers can be resized without loss of quality, making them ideal for zoomable maps.
2. **File Size**: SVG files are typically smaller in size compared to raster images, which helps in reducing load times.
3. **Customization**: SVGs can be easily styled and manipulated with CSS, allowing for dynamic changes based on user interactions or states.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure that SVG markers have appropriate titles and descriptions for screen readers to enhance accessibility.

## Usage

To use the SVG markers in your React Native application, import them as components or use them as image sources in your map components. Ensure that your map rendering logic accommodates the SVG format for optimal performance.
